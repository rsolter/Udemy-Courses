       "        'Best new reissue 1 / 2 Albums Newly reissued and remastered, the group\\x92s first two albums find Jeff Tweedy and his Chicago band transforming themselves from alt-country also-rans into a formidable rock\\x91n\\x92roll outfit. The nuclear detonation of Uncle Tupelo launched an alt-country arms race, with the band\\x92s two chief singer-songwriters mutating from old friends into bitter enemies trying to outdo each other with their follow-up records. Jay Farrar started Son Volt with Tupelo\\x92s drummer, Mike Heidorn, and released Trace, which yielded the radio hit \\x93Drown\\x94 and found him greeted as a visionary. Jeff Tweedy, on the other hand, rushed into the studio to record a set of demos with his new band, Wilco, barely a couple months after his old band had played its final show. Nearly a year later they released their first album, A.M., which was greeted with a big shrug from critics and fans alike. Tweedy had managed to retain almost every member of Uncle Tupelo\\x92s expanded line-up: multi-instrumentalist Max Johnston, guitarist John Stirratt, drummer Ken Coomer, even guitarist Brian Henneman, of the Bottle Rockets. In fact, the group briefly flirted with the idea of keeping the Uncle Tupelo name, although wiser heads prevailed and they rechristened themselves after trucker lingo for \\x93will comply.\\x94 Still, despite their familiarity and camaraderie, Wilco were still trying to figure out who they were when they wrote and recorded A.M.\\x97a necessary step for any band, but especially for one whose de facto frontman had spent the last decade-plus in the shadow of the more forceful Farrar. The original mix of A.M. was, reportedly, much grittier and more akin to Uncle Tupelo\\x92s early material than to the cleaner, more polished version that finally made its way into CD stores in March 1995. The final version is fine, although A.M. is the very definition of 1990s alt-country: as conservative as punk rock, with flourishes of pedal steel and a gentle twang to frame Tweedy\\x92s hard-luck tales of casino losing streaks, suspended licenses, and custody battles over record collections. \\x93I Must Be High\\x94 nods toward the sunny pop of Summerteeth and beyond, and \\x93Box Full of Letters\\x94 and \\x93Passenger Side\\x94 hint at the melancholy melodicism that would become Tweedy\\x92s stock in trade. He wanted Wilco to be a collaborative and democratic unit rather than a glorified solo project, though only one of his bandmates\\x92 songs made the final cut: the gently loping \\x93It\\x92s Just That Simple,\\x94 courtesy of Stirratt (who pens the new liner notes for this expanded edition). Otherwise, the MVP of the album is Henneman, who was a fine foil for Tweedy. There\\x92s real wit and warmth in his guitar riffs, even if he was merely a rental rather than a full band member. According to Learning How to Die, Greg Kot\\x92s 2004 biography of the band, Henneman recorded his part for the raucous throwaway \\x93Casino Queen\\x94 while nursing a broken heart; he downed two bottles of gin before the tape started rolling, and he plays like he\\x92s holding on for dear life. A.M. is an album persistently defined by unfavorable comparisons, first to Son Volt\\x92s Trace and later to every other Wilco album. And certainly there\\x92s a timidity here that must have been discouraging after Tweedy\\x92s strong contributions to Uncle Tupelo\\x92s final pair of albums. But there\\x92s also a lot of humor and sadness to these songs, which are circumscribed and local in their scope. That\\x92s the charm of this modest reissue, which includes only a handful of bonus tracks (including the final Uncle Tupelo recording and a Blue Mountain cover) but treats A.M. as something more than a footnote to Wilco\\x92s long career. In 2017, the album plays like a band setting its terms, striving to keep everything perfectly human-size. As much as the band was compared to that other Uncle Tupelo offshoot, Wilco\\x92s biggest rivals were themselves. Tweedy, meanwhile, was struggling to grow up. Then in his late 20s, he quit smoking pot, a vice he\\x92d adopted after quitting drinking a few years before. He married his girlfriend and prepared to become a father. And he made some painful adjustments to his expectations once A.M. floundered and ticket sales cratered. If he hadn\\x92t turned those setbacks into songs, you probably wouldn\\x92t be reading a review of any Wilco reissues. Being There is every bit as confident as their debut was shaky: a double album tied together by a loose theme of what it means to be in a rock\\x91n\\x92roll band. It opens with a big blast of lurching, serrating guitar distortion, sinewy and visceral and violent, which sounds like they\\x92re tearing up A.M. so they can start over again. What\\x92s amazing is how well it works. After the grinding din that begins and ends opener \\x93Misunderstood,\\x94 Tweedy\\x92s songs have a brand new context. \\x93Far, Far Away\\x94 and \\x93I Got You (At the End of the Century)\\x94 aren\\x92t actually that different from A.M., but they sound heavier, riskier, the stakes so much greater that it could be a different band altogether. There are some country flourishes, specifically the pedal steel courtesy of Freakwater\\x92s Bob Egan, but Wilco had managed to transform itself from an alt-country also-ran into a real rock band: noise rock, classic rock, folk rock, heartland rock, every kind of rock. A conceptually knotty record, Being There contains barely veiled references to a breakup, but most listeners at the time would have understood them as references to Uncle Tupelo rather than a romantic partner. \\x93Monday,\\x94 with its Stonesy brass stomp, is about a guy in \\x93a plenty good band\\x94 who can only watch as others get all the glory, and you can guess what might have inspired Tweedy\\x92s wry observations about fame and futility.  There are a few pulled punches (\\x93I know you\\x92re just a mama\\x92s boy\\x94 doesn\\x92t have much sting), but thankfully, these aren\\x92t dis tracks or bitter recriminations. Jay Farrar\\x92s only a minor concern; these songs are first and foremost about Jeff Tweedy and his misgivings about his own talent. That had been a detriment on A.M.; on Being There it\\x92s the band\\x92s greatest strength and truest subject. Rock\\x91n\\x92roll is a sucker\\x92s bet on these songs, something you pour your heart and soul and money and labor and dreams into and for what? Creative and financial frustration? \\x93We\\x92ve got solid-state technology,\\x94 Tweedy sings on \\x93Red-Eyed and Blue\\x94; \\x93Tapes on the floor/Some songs we can\\x92t afford to play.\\x94 So, why were they even doing it? That\\x92s what Wilco are trying to figure out on Being There, and they need your help. It\\x92s useful to imagine each of these songs being sung from the stage directly and explicitly to the audience who has paid to see Wilco. As Tweedy sings on \\x93I Got You (At the End of the Century),\\x94 \\x93I got you and I still believe that you\\x92re all that I will ever need/It\\x92s you.\\x94 That \\x93you\\x94 means us. Are we enough for them? Is our applause really that valuable? Being There flirts with cynicism, but really the mood is sober, world-weary, adult. \\x93There is no sunken treasure/Rumored to be wrapped inside my ribs,\\x94 Tweedy sings on \\x93Sunken Treasure,\\x94 the slow-burn epic that anchors the second disc of this double album. \\x93Music is my savior/I was maimed by rock and roll.\\x94 If rock had once been a liberating medium, after Nirvana it had become an albatross around the neck of every dreamer with a guitar. But Tweedy finds his way in the end: Closer \\x93Dreamer in My Dreams\\x94 may be the most unflinchingly personal song on the record, but it\\x92s also the wildest, the wooliest, maybe the most raucous Wilco have ever sounded. \\x93Well I know I\\x92ve made mistakes,\\x94 he sings; \\x93I\\x92m passing them on.\\x94 Just when you think the song is ending, the band kicks it up again, as though reluctant to stop playing. Only when the song ends do they have to face real life again. At the heart of this bruised and tender record is the frazzled relationship between artist and audience, which makes this reissue more powerful and essential than your typical album repackaging. Digital media means we as an audience have less and less to give an artist, and rock\\x91n\\x92roll may be even more of a fool\\x92s errand now than it was in 1996, when people bought CDs by the handful and even a mid-level band like pre-Foxtrot Wilco could make a comfortable living driving around the country in a van. Being There sounds even direr and more desperate than it once did, and the bonus material expands upon its themes. The \\x93Party Horn\\x94 mix of \\x93Monday\\x94 actually sounds richer and more excitable than the studio version, especially with its screeching sax solo. Most of the outtakes and alternate takes still have studio chatter attached to them, showing the band goofing around in the studio or half-assing the demos. \\x93I think that was good enough,\\x94 Tweedy deadpans after a beautifully understated version of \\x93Dynamite My Soul.\\x94 All of Tweedy\\x92s big ideas about his vocation sound even more volatile on the two full live sets included on the 5xCD version, with \\x93Sunken Treasure\\x94 and \\x93Hotel Arizona\\x94 making the most of Tweedy\\x92s rapport with the audience (\\x93This is a true story. Sorta.\\x94) and the noise of the crowd. Maybe that\\x92s where the album\\x92s title comes from. It is, of course, a reference to the 1979 Peter Sellers film, but it\\x92s also a twist on the old adage about concerts and concert films: I guess you had to be there. We\\x92ve always been a crucial part of Being There, always an unseen force motivating Wilco from one show to the next, but these live cuts make it explicit. It\\x92s as though Tweedy played the long game on this sucker\\x92s bet, waiting 21 years to make the ultimate version of Being There.',\n",

       "        'On his corrosive fifth album, the rapper takes aim at several targets and whiffs spectacularly. His verbose, tryhard technique is a tired formula he employs without flow, direction, or meaning. Hopsin\\x97the California rapper whose constricting flows and humorless turns suck all the fun out of rapping\\x97made his reputation appealing to the angstier corners of the internet, inhabited by rap moralists and \\x93alternative thinkers\\x94\\x97those who earnestly think Tech N9ne is Peak Underground Rap. His new album, No Shame, is a bitter, petulant response to recent setbacks and mistakes: the collapse of his Funk Volume label, the souring of personal and professional relationships, and losing custody of his son after pleading guilty to assault. But he refuses to back down. \\x93I built this empire off rebellion/Niggas seem to have a problem with what I be sellin\\x92,\\x94 he raps on \\x93Panorama City,\\x94 a song using a \\x93California Love\\x94 sample as a Thug Life signifier. When given the chance to explain himself, he doubles down on the worst aspects of an irritating persona. No Shame is a misfired revenge stunt. He takes aim at several targets and whiffs spectacularly, producing the worst album of his career, filled with tryhard wordplay and defamation that verges on abuse. \\x93This album is backlash for somebody else. This album is pretty much just karma for people who have screwed me over or done something wrong to me,\\x94 he told Tim Westwood. Those people are his former business partner, manager, and Funk Volume co-founder, Damien Ritter, and his ex-girlfriend, who Hopsin was arrested for assaulting in Australia last year. The barbs he has for Ritter are boring enough, but those reserved for his ex are particularly dark. Hopsin leaves no room for interpretation: He uses No Shame (and the press tour promoting it) to get back at the mother of his child, to damage her any way he can: \\x93I fuckin\\x92 hate this bitch, her name could sit on a grave/Only reason she ain\\x92t dead is \\x91cause my kid on the way/The bitch is pregnant and she strippin\\x92, dodgin\\x92 minimum wage/She done kick me down, locked me up, and spit on my face,\\x94 he raps, enraged on \\x93All Your Fault (Remix).\\x94 This is a rapper using the full weight of his musical machine to discredit a woman he pled guilty to assaulting. And even for all his attempts to disgrace and humiliate her, smearing her with slut-shaming tactics and leveraging the entire force of his fan base against her, he still comes off looking much worse. Hopsin takes pride in his writing, making fun of \\x93mumble rappers\\x94 and those he perceives to be lesser lyricists, but his ideas are always articulated in the most corrosive ways possible; his set-ups and images are awkward, distasteful, and off-putting. Creepiness is an important part of his aesthetic\\x97the colored contact lenses, deranged rambler rhyme mechanics (a la Eminem), and so-sinister-they\\x92re-campy performances are all tools he uses to paint himself as a rap iconoclast. But even he pushes the limits of likability on No Shame. Slim Shady is his patron saint, and \\x93Rap God\\x94 is his scripture. All of his defining principles originate there, only executed without grace or guile. Even his horrible, vitriolic anti-ex tirades are cribbed right from the \\x93Kim\\x94 playbook.  Rage isn\\x92t a substitute for artistry. He\\x92ll rap nonsense for the sake of the scheme (\\x94Napalm in my dang palm/I\\x92m a dark villain like Blade, Spawn, or Akon with a cape on\\x94). His scenes are insipid. His phrasings are either basic and unsophisticated or simply unnatural, playing up the phonetics as a distraction. \\x93Evil and purgin\\x92, I am more deceiving in person/Screamin\\x92 and cursin\\x92, fuck the world with penis insertions/I\\x92ma feel this way until the day I\\x92m leavin\\x92 this Earth, man,\\x94 he raps on \\x93Witch Doctor.\\x94 You can almost hear him asking himself, \\x93what rhymes with this?\\x94 making raps purposelessly denser with complete disregard for syntax. The songs that aren\\x92t vehicles for his hatred are pointless exercises, each an elaborate convolution. Most Hopsin verses are assembled the same way, with choppy, rapid-fire cadences of multisyllabic filler. Every diphthong and accent ricochets off the next, creating the illusion of mastery when really, it\\x92s less complex than letting an algorithm generate raps from scratch. There\\x92s no value in craftsmanship alone; there has to be flow, direction, and meaning. \\x93Rap monster, Black Mamba/You can\\x92t run from the wrath I\\x92ve been asked to cast on ya/To all the haters who been keepin\\x92 up with my every move/Here\\x92s my penis to latch on/I\\x92m the only MC in this wack genre,\\x94 he raps, following his technicality-first formula. And if there was any doubt that he\\x92s detrimentally a creature of habit, he\\x92s now nine songs deep in an \\x93Ill Mind of Hopsin\\x94 series that ran out of ideas four songs ago. Things get even more unpleasant when Hopsin takes detours. On \\x93Happy Ending,\\x94 he raps about getting off at a massage parlor in a terrible mock accent, mimicking the masseuse for the hook: \\x93If you no say nothing, I can give you sucky-sucky.\\x94 It would be one thing if the song was just crude or offensive or unlistenable, but it\\x92s a trifecta. There aren\\x92t any moments of remorse or thoughtfulness on No Shame, but there are a few moments of reflection. \\x93I don\\x92t like Marcus, I don\\x92t like Hopsin/I am ashamed of them both,\\x94 he raps on \\x93Marcus\\x92 Gospel\\x94 before concluding, \\x93I made my bed, I\\x92ma lay in it.\\x94 These bars would have you believe Hopsin has learned from his mistakes. But No Shame proves otherwise. The album rebukes any and all responsibility for his current predicament, shifting blame onto others. And in an attempt to weaponize his raps against his adversaries, he exposes his deepest flaws. His album is a reminder that shame is a productive and even necessary thing, keeping us from further making fools of ourselves.',\n",

       "        'On their first album in 15 years, the Long Island post-hardcore band Glassjaw picks up right where they left off. But their heaviest material yet is, at times, lacking in dynamics and atmosphere. Material Control wouldn\\x92t exist if Daryl Palumbo didn\\x92t believe it was \\x93the most Glassjaw-sounding music we could be making at this point.\\x94 There is no doubting the purity of their vision, as lead single \\x93New White Extremity\\x94 is Glassjaw as hell. Its aggression and abrasive, abstract skronk tie together New York hardcore and no wave, mixed with astringent third-wave emo melody and the CGI\\x92d musculature of nu-metal production\\x97all with Palumbo doing his ocean-sized roar over it all like Long Island\\x92s answer to Perry Farrell. In 2015, the band released \\x93New White Extremity\\x94 as a one-off, assumed to lead up to this very moment, where it serves as the opener for the first Glassjaw album in 15 years. If there was any doubt whether Glassjaw can pick up where they left off, Material Control answers it as immediately and literally as possible. Whether or not they were doubted, Glassjaw were going to act as if they were. They\\x92re a band that\\x92s thrived in a state of constant conflict. Fan favorites from their 2000 debut Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence include \\x93Pretty Lush\\x94 and \\x93Ry-Ry\\x92s Song,\\x94 chief exhibits among the evidence of their scene\\x92s ingrained misogyny. These were scorched-earth responses to romantic betrayal performed with such energy that they sound like an endorsement. With their 2002 album Worship and Tribute, Glassjaw were positioned as post-hardcore\\x92s Next Big Thing, forged under the pressure of Warner Bros. execs, the Twin Towers of nu-metal (producer Ross Robinson, mixer Chris Lord-Alge), and the band\\x92s own outsized ambitions. It didn\\x92t have the impact of, say, Relationship of Command, but like At the Drive In, Glassjaw followed their frenzied, fraught breakthrough by taking the next decade off. While creating Material Control, multi-instrumentalist Justin Beck (he and Palumbo constitute the core of Glassjaw) asked a rhetorical question: \\x93Yo, if we were 14 again and recording with Martin Bisi and could just be the illest, grimiest band in New York, what would the environment be like?\\x94 This is a smart approach, especially in the wake of recent albums from post-hardcore greats like At the Drive In, Refused, and Quicksand. Think of the fan who found those other albums to be hella soft, who wrongly assumed that Palumbo would remain too committed to the pop ambitions of his regrettably-named electronica outfits Head Automatica and Colour Film\\x97Material Control is for that person. Material Control certainly can lay claim to being Glassjaw\\x92s heaviest or most aggro album. And though most of Palumbo\\x92s lyrics are too circumspect to get much across beyond their titles (\\x93My Conscience Weighs a Ton,\\x94 \\x93Bibleland 6\\x94), he says it\\x92s political in a \\x93George Carlin way.\\x94 \\x93New White Extremity\\x94 surveys the demographics of a new Brooklyn, which Beck describes as \\x93white people from Kansas.\\x94 Despite their multimedia affinity for gruff, hardscrabble NYC cynicism, Material Control lives in the now, one of constant physical and mental confrontation and claustrophobia. Like their hardcore heroes, Glassjaw want you to feel the experience of getting constantly elbowed on the street and the subway, only now it also happens while staring at an iPhone and getting constantly prodded by bad opinions. Nearly every second of Material Control is meant to duplicate this sensory overload. Beck, in particular, puts forth a performance of remarkable endurance and dexterity, neck-snap riffs constantly battling his textural playing in the right channel, intended as field recordings from the concrete jungle\\x97circular saws meeting sheet metal, the blare of car horns, jammed traffic. Without Dillinger Escape Plan to use as an outlet anymore, drummer Billy Rymer pushes his new band to their most feral extremes, shuttling from groove-metal, d-beat insanity, free-form dub, and tabla-spiked drone in consecutive tracks. But Glassjaw are so intent on proving they can still Glassjaw that they leave no space to build, to create dynamics or generate atmosphere. They really leave no space for Palumbo, and while there are distinct choruses, there are no hooks. There are more memorable basslines than vocal melodies. If Glassjaw was expected to top their forebears like Orange 9mm and Mind Over Matter as a commercial proposition, though, it was due to Palumbo\\x97a \\x93Jeff Buckley-in-hell post-hardcore,\\x94 an unusually magnetic presence for this grotty realm. But he can\\x92t work within these arrangements so much as over or under them. Palumbo elongates vowels while improvising pitch and hoping for the best. Elsewhere, he\\x92s almost completely submerged in a mix created without nuance or mercy. If you can withstand the initial onslaught of Material Control, it can be plucked for stems: the cooed harmonies on \\x93Shira,\\x94 the warm bass countermelodies from \\x93Golgotha,\\x94 any of the individual elements of \\x93Pretty Hell.\\x94 The latter serves as the kind of U-turn into amniotic balladry that has sustained the midsections of Deftones albums for the past 20 years. Despite its studied dub production, \\x93Pretty Hell\\x94 is a mess that wastes the strongest chorus on an arrangement where no instrument appears to be aware of the other\\x92s existence. There are points where Glassjaw can work towards a satisfying payoff rather than going all in at once, like the raga experiment \\x93Bastille Day\\x94 and the title track, which both aspire to the symphonic grandeur of major-label Trail of Dead. To Palumbo\\x92s credit, he recognizes the potency of being that angry, impulsive 14-year-old hardcore kid\\x97though he\\x92s now channeling his adolescent rage towards more worthy targets. On an immediate level, Material Control is a record that simply feels good to have, specifically at the end of 2017\\x97a time when everyone\\x92s coming together to praise the year\\x92s most agreeable rock records, when every day brings further proof that the arc of the moral universe has gone way the fuck off course, when you just want to scream into the void. Think of Material Control as a post-hardcore Long Island tea: it\\x92ll take you back to being a teen when you could care less what was in it and how it was mixed together. The only thing that mattered was whether you got knocked on your ass.',\n",

Sometimes I just love to pretend to be a record reviewer! In my last review, I stated that Don Caballero was \"creating cohesive songs from the cacaphony of frenetically beaten drums.\" Yeah, right! More like creating a goopy mess of my brain between my ears. Well, here I find myself, living a Dilbert- like existence, not even given the dignity of a cubicle, forced to isolate myself the only way I know how: headphones filled with grunchy, mean toonz. Sure, sometimes I listen to porn MPEGs or NPR\\'s This American Life, but when I\\'m given a particularly enervating task-- something like, say, stapling-- I like to put my head between the hairy thighs of Don Caballero. Sure, it smells a little funky down there, and all\\'s I can hear is the pounding of drums upon my skull, but I like it. I see it as an expression against the machine of oppression, man! Yeah, oppression... Don C., in case you\\'ve been too lazy to go back and read the earlier review, is intense, indie jam-rok of the highest order. Perhaps you\\'ve got friends that like to noodle around with offbeat guitar themes and love to hammer their drum sets without mercy. Perhaps they drink malt liquor and smell like clove cigarettes. Perhaps they stick sharp, barbed objects into their bottoms. Perhaps you have a very vague idea of what we\\'re talking about here: jamming. Stinky, sore- bottomed jamming. Inspired, sore- bottomed jamming. Wikked, sharp, tight, sore- bottomed jamming. No lyrics, no mandolin, no techno beats or phat rhymes, just pure, glorious, sore- bottomed jamming. Thank You Jesus! So, Singles Breaking Up (Vol 1) collects the band\\'s EP and compilation releases into one, easy- to- use compact disc. Convenient, and perfect for the on- the- go individual, Singles has the texture you\\'d expect from such a collection-- lacking the overall continuity that What Burns Never Returns possessed, it serves to chronicle their progress since 1992, before they even released their first album, 1993\\'s For Respect. Since this stuff is clearly marketed to instrumento-geeks and weirdos, I would suggest you take a large dose of Ketamine before enjoying.

       "        'Out of Tune is a Steve Martin album. Yes, I\\'ll explain: \\\\n\\\\n\\\\ Once upon a time, there was ... Out of Tune is a Steve Martin album. Yes, I\\'ll explain: Once upon a time, there was Steve Martin, a man with a plan to make us all laugh. His preferred method of inducing laughter was absurdity, doing his \"Ramblin\\' Man\" thang for a while before finally finding a shortcut called \"Excuuuuuuse me!\" You kids these days may not know it, but if you said those two words just right, the whole wide world of 1976 was on their knees, suffocating with laughter. Continuing his domination by laughter, Martin did a few movies, most notably \"The Jerk,\" one of the finest feature films of all time. Public opinion on \"Just how funny is this Steve Martin guy, anyhow?\" took a downslide once the \\'80s began. His movies remained true to his desire to be Mr. Absurd (\"The Man With Two Brains\" probably being the apex of the truly hilarious/ nobody cares period), until finally he began to shift gears... crashing head on into a 1986 mess called \"The Three Amigos.\" A horrible, unfunny film, Martin nonetheless recovered just a year later with \"Roxanne\" and one of his finest works, \"Planes Trains and Automobiles.\" Do you see where I\\'m going with this? Oh, wait. I haven\\'t even gotten there. Martin went right into the toilet shortly thereafter, trying to first become more sitcom- friendly (\"Houseguest\"), then semi- dramatic (\"Leap of Faith\"), until he released a movie that nobody went to see called \"A Simple Twist of Fate.\" Released in 1993, this was a seriously tragic and poorly- done flick about a man and his pet orphan who, if you can imagine, becomes the focus of a nasty custody dispute. When I first heard about this \"Fate\" bullshit, I thought it was a joke. Catching a few minutes of it a couple of weeks back, I was stunned. Here was a man who used to be in sync with that white noise comedy Robin Williams also excelled at. And, by the way, look at the unfortunate high grosses for \"Patch Adams.\" Williams can at least laugh all the way to the bank with his betrayal of funny. Martin had to flop yet again with \"The Out of Towners,\" but not before he did the also not- too- funny \"Sgt. Bilko.\" Oh, yeah. Mojave 3. Three of these kids used to be in a band called Slowdive. Slowdive was to shoegazing what Steve Martin was to funny circa 1979. Slowdive wasn\\'t more complex than their notorious peers, My Bloody Valentine, and they weren\\'t as drunk as Ride, but they sure did make some purdy rekkids. Of course, they had to eventually blow off what they were good at to make their own \"Simple Twist of Fate,\" an unfortunate album called Ask Me Tomorrow. And in their desire to be taken seriously, they cast off what made \\'em so goddamned good in the first place. Out of Tune isn\\'t a step back into Slowdive mode, but it is a much more winsome affair than Tomorrow. I had more hopes just based on the cover alone. (If there are any of those giant Eurpoean subway posters for this floating around, I have a wall in dire need of beauty.) Neil Halstead and Rachel Goswell sing a little differently than back in the day, going aurally naked (sans a zillion effects) and stepping out into the SoCal pot- happy sunshine folk- rock thing they\\'re doing now. No, it doesn\\'t sound like the Eagles, but a few cuts remind me of that godawful shit Ethan Hawke got to sing. Okay, not really, but somewhere Ethan Hawke is just popping a boner because someone mentioned his name in the press again. So, what do I think overall? It\\'s not as meaty as it could be. Whereas Slowdive\\'s lyrics were more enigmatic (or maybe appeared to be through a fog of tremelo), Mojave 3 goes for those bold statements that annoy me. Check these songs titles: \"Who Do You Love\" (no, not that one), \"Some Kinda Angel\" (where Goswell conjures up some Stevie Nicks mojo), \"All Your Tears,\" \"Baby\\'s Coming Home...\" you get the idea. Lots of acoustic guitars, organ, some pedal steel, and harmonies make this a pleasant enough sort of listen as long as I take a bong hit and stare at the cover. Or, to boil it all down into one sentence, this could very well be the first 4AD album to be fully embraced by both AAA radio stations and your mom. File it somewhere between \"Housesitter\" and \"Father of the Bride.\" Post Review Note: I just got back from Cellophane Square music store on University Avenue in Seattle, and I guess I should mention that, according to a Mojave 3 display, a clerk named Karrie really digs the songs \"Caught Beneath Your Feet\" and \"This Road I\\'m Traveling.\" I\\'m not doing this to hit on her-- I didn\\'t ask for Karrie and for all I know she\\'s an ugg-o-- but if you\\'re a rabid Mojave 3 fan who doesn\\'t like what I have to say, take Karrie\\'s endorsement to heart.',\n",

       "        'Neil Hamburger\\'s third comedy release is a desperate affair, even for a sad sack such as America\\'s Funnyman ... Neil Hamburger\\'s third comedy release is a desperate affair, even for a sad sack such as America\\'s Funnyman. Hamburger-- aka Gregg Turkington-- takes his routine to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, warming up the locals before karaoke time. Too bad nobody in the audience speaks or understands English. It\\'s a broad setup knocked down with Hamburger\\'s usual patheticness. (Sample joke: \"How many Spice Girls does it take to screw in a lightbulb? Well, it was five, now it\\'s four, and I\\'m sure any day now it\\'ll be down to three. Uh, huhhhh...\") Early on in the show, Hamburger realizes no one in the crowd speaks English and, worse yet, his manager and right- hand man Art Huckman flees the scene in a huff. With no one left to lean on, Neil opens up about his past gigs performing at Amway conventions, his failed marriage, and a little something called \"Montezuma\\'s Revenge.\" Is it funny? Not really, but that\\'s the point. Left for Dead in Malaysia is forty minutes of flop sweats, so much so that you might feel moist after listening. As usual, the joke is on Hamburger; is there a bigger loser on the planet than this guy? Yes, but the flat routine on Left for Dead may have you thinking otherwise. Hamburger (or Turkington, to be more precise) hits the desperation nail square on the head, but Raw Hamburger and America\\'s Funnyman both fared a lot better. I\\'m sure that there\\'s going to be another Neil Hamburger album-- the stage is easily set for this loser to sink even lower-- and those who enjoyed the previous albums will enjoy Left for Dead more than the folks who don\\'t get the joke. But there aren\\'t really any jokes on this album, just a series of empty shells and failed observations... classic Hamburger.',\n",
